My experiments in the problem-space of compression.
This is an implementation of binary arithmetic coding[1] in Common Lisp.
The code uses SBCL hash-tables extensions, and runs hopelessly slow on any implementation other than SBCL.

The modeling and the encoding are decoupled, making it possible to test different models.
For now the only test included is a simple Markov model with a naive context mixing approach.
